I set you a place at the table
Hoping maybe you would change your mind
Please come home when you're able
Until then, I'll pour you a glass of wine

And if it were easy
Everybody'd be doin' it
'Cause everybody likes adrenaline
Everybody loves a hero
But it's not easy
Worrying you might get hurt, no
Everybody says it's hard
They don't know hard
'Cause honey, I loved you first

I swear to God I felt your pain
Thought I sensed it in the rain
The day you thought you lost your body
My hands were shaking on the phone
What a crime to be alone
In the moment things went dark

And if it were easy
Everybody'd be doin' it
'Cause everybody likes adrenaline
Everybody loves a hero
But it's not easy
Worrying you might get hurt, no
Everybody says it's hard
They don't know hard
'Cause honey, I loved you first

(First)

Stop, you don't have to be
A soldier around me
Stop, you don't have to be

Oh
Stop, you don't have to be
A soldier around me
Stop, you don't have to be

Stop, you don't have to be
A soldier around me

'Cause if it were easy
Everybody'd be doin' it
'Cause everybody likes adrenaline
Everybody loves a hero
But it's not easy
Worrying you might get hurt, no
Everybody says it's hard
They don't know hard
'Cause honey, I loved you first
