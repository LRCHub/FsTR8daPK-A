I read about it, how you changed your name
You always wanted, that special day
You'll probably see the world, and when the time is right, you'll make another you, I hope he has your smile
And I know we had our flaws, stitched together with good intentions,
I can deal with being alone
I'll let go cause I know I should
Cause I know that you'll be happy
and I know you're loving someone, but me
I can take it but the one thing that's really
hurting the worst:
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first
Don't get it twisted, boy I'm not upset, you've found
another love. I'm happy that we gave our best
They say for happiness, you gotta take that risk,
you did the right thing, boy to not settle for this
And I know we had our flaws, stitched together
with good intentions, I can deal with being alone
I'll let go cause I know I should
Cause I know that you'll be happy
and I know you're loving someone, but me
I can take it but the one thing that's really
hurting the worst:
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first
I can take it but the one thing that's really
hurting the worst: I'm the one that loved you first
Do you remember when we said we're in this
whatever. Do you remember our first fight, first cry
together. Do you remember when we first lied,
first said forever. Now when I close my eyes
I remember the time
Cause I know that you'll be happy
and I know you're loving someone, but me
I can take it but the one thing that's really
hurting the worst:
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first

I can take it but the one thing that's really
hurting the worst:
I'm the one that loved you first
I'm the one that loved you first
