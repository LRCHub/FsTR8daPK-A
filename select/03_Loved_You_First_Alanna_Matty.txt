I loved you first
Maybe that's when the problem starts
It still hurts
Knowing I was barely in your heart

And I've watched you grow
Oh, I've watched you grow from a distance
And now I know
That there was no way to resist it

You've come so far
Just to leave it all behind
So get in your car
And pretend that you never mind

This is why I shouldn't love you first
I shouldn't love you first

And I could've never let you go
I would have held on
And watched the world burn
There was never a love behind your eyes

This is why
This is why
I shouldn't love you first
Shouldn't love you, oh, at all
Shouldn't love you first
I shouldn't love you, shouldn't love you
